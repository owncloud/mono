Enhancement: make frontend prefixes configurable

We introduce three new environment variables and preconfigure them the following way:

```
REVA_FRONTEND_DATAGATEWAY_PREFIX="data"
REVA_FRONTEND_OCDAV_PREFIX=""
REVA_FRONTEND_OCS_PREFIX="ocs"
```

This restores the reva defaults that were changed upstream.
