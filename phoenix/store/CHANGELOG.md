## Details

   ARM builds were failing when built on alpine:edge, so we switched to alpine:latest instead.

* Change - Initial release of basic version: [#1](https://github.com/owncloud/mono/store/pull/1)

   We have built a new service which implements go micro's [store
   interface](https://github.com/micro/development/blob/master/design/framework/store.md),
   so that we can provide a key-value-store through GRPC for our services. The underlying
   implementation stores data as json files on disk and maintains an index using
   [bleve](https://github.com/blevesearch/bleve).
