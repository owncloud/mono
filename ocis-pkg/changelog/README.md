# Changelog

We are using [calens](https://github.com/restic/calens) to properly generate a
changelog before we are tagging a new release. To get an idea how this could
look like <https://github.com/restic/restic/tree/master/changelog> would be the
best reference.

We're using kebab case for naming the changelog files:

`kebab-case-looks-like-this`
