Enhancement: Improve visual appearance of accounts UI

We aligned the visual appearance of the accounts UI with default ocis-web apps (full width, style of batch actions), added icons to buttons, extracted the buttons from the batch actions dropdown into individual buttons, improved the wording added a confirmation widget for the user deletion and removed the uid and gid columns.
